# Warp AI Rules for this project

## Development Server Management
- DO NOT automatically run `npm run dev` or start development servers
- DO NOT run servers after making code changes
- User will manually start/stop servers as needed
- Only run build commands (`npm run build`) for validation when requested

## Code Changes
- Focus on code implementation and testing compilation
- Use `npm run build` to validate changes when appropriate
- Suggest manual server restart if needed, but don't execute it

## Testing
- Only run tests when explicitly requested
- Prefer build validation over running development servers
