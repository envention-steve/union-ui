# Next.js Page Refactor Plan

## Overview
- Several dashboard detail pages have ballooned into 600â€“4000 line files that mix data fetching, domain transforms, global state management, and UI rendering, making maintenance and testing difficult.
- We will progressively extract cohesive feature components, colocated hooks, and shared utilities to shrink each page, improve reuse, and enable targeted tests.
- Refactors should keep existing route structure while moving logic into `components/features`, `hooks`, and `lib` folders per repository guidelines. Each extraction should be paired with refreshed tests that mirror the new file layout under `__tests__`.

## Refactor Plans by Page

### `app/dashboard/members/[id]/page.tsx` (3985 lines)
- **Responsibilities:** End-to-end member management (profile editing, dependents, coverage, life insurance, employer relationships, notes, claims/adjustments, annuity payouts, fund ledger) with extensive API transforms and in-tab forms.
- **Pain Points:** Monolithic component, duplicated fetch logic, heavy state coupling across tabs, large inline JSX tables, complex unsaved-change handling, difficult testability.
- **Refactor Plan:**
  - Create a `components/features/members/member-detail-layout` that renders tabs and delegates content to tab-specific components.
  - Extract tab bodies into colocated components: `MemberOverviewTab`, `DependentsTab`, `HealthCoverageTab`, `LifeInsuranceTab`, `EmployersTab`, `NotesTab`, `ClaimsAdjustmentsTab`, `AnnuityPayoutTab`, `FundLedgerTab`.
  - Move ledger table, filters, and row expansion into `components/features/members/ledger/` with reusable `LedgerTable` and `LedgerEntryDetails` components.
  - Introduce hooks in `hooks/` (`useMemberDetails`, `useMemberLedger`, `useMemberNotes`, `useMemberClaims`, etc.) responsible for fetching, caching, and mutations. Use React Query or SWR later if available; otherwise, keep backend client usage inside hooks.
  - Place data mappers and constants (tab arrays, select options) in `lib/members/transformers.ts` and `lib/members/constants.ts`.
  - Wrap shared state (mode, unsaved changes) in a lightweight context provider scoped to the page to remove prop drilling.
- **Testing:** Replace the monolithic test with suites per tab component and hook (e.g., `__tests__/components/features/members/member-overview-tab.test.tsx`, `__tests__/hooks/useMemberLedger.test.ts`). Add integration test covering tab switching and context interactions.
- **Progress:** Established `MemberDetailContext` with a provider, moved tab bodies into `components/features/members/member-overview` (overview, dependents, employers, notes, claims/adjustments, annuity payout, fund ledger), introduced the `MemberDetailLayout` shell, and extracted hooks for notes, form handlers, claims/adjustments, ledger, overview state, and the core `useMemberDetails` workflow backed by `lib/members/transformers.ts`. Added focused specs across the tab suite (e.g., `__tests__/components/features/members/MemberOverviewTab.test.tsx`, `MemberDependentsTab.test.tsx`, `MemberNotesTab.test.tsx`).
- **Next Actions:**
  - Replace the remaining inline JSX in `app/dashboard/members/[id]/page.tsx` with the new tab components wired through `MemberDetailLayout` and the context provider, reusing the extracted hooks for fetches and mutations.
  - Add an integration spec that exercises tab switching plus the shared context once layout adoption is complete (hook coverage for `useMemberDetails`, `useMemberLedger`, `useMemberFormHandlers`, and `useMemberClaimsAdjustments` is now in place).
  - Remove obsolete inline handlers/modals (e.g., legacy beneficiary dialog wiring, ledger row logic) after confirming parity with the extracted modules, then retire the legacy Member Detail spec.

### `app/dashboard/employers/[id]/page.tsx` (1545 lines)
- **Responsibilities:** Employer detail editing, rates management, notes, member listing, and ledger/batch interaction.

  - Build `EmployerDetailLayout` with tab navigation and lean container page.
  - Extract tabs into `EmployerProfileTab`, `EmployerRatesTab`, `EmployerNotesTab`, `EmployerMembersTab`, `EmployerLedgerTab` under `components/features/employers/`.
  - Create hooks (`useEmployerDetails`, `useEmployerRates`, `useEmployerLedger`) and share form schemas/utilities in `lib/employers/`.
  - Reuse generic address/phone/email form components pulled out to `components/features/shared/contact-methods/`.
  - Encapsulate unsaved-change detection in a hook (`useUnsavedChanges`), reuseable across pages.

- **Progress:** Created reusable scaffolding (`EmployerDetailHeader`, `EmployerDetailTabs`) in `components/features/employers/employer-detail-layout` with shared tab metadata in `lib/employers/constants.ts`; page still renders legacy tab bodies inline.
- **Next Actions:**
  - Extract tab components (`EmployerProfileTab`, `EmployerRatesTab`, `EmployerNotesTab`, `EmployerMembersTab`, `EmployerLedgerTab`) and compose them through the layout primitives, wiring each to dedicated hooks.
  - Move fetch/transform helpers into `lib/employers` alongside new hooks (`useEmployerDetails`, `useEmployerRates`, `useEmployerLedger`) to remove direct API calls from the page.
  - Add component tests for the layout primitives and first migrated tab, then port the existing employer detail spec to the modular setup.

### `app/dashboard/insurance-plans/[id]/page.tsx` (1162 lines)

- **Next Actions:**
  - Carve tab bodies into `PlanOverviewTab`, `EligibilityTab`, `CoverageTab`, `PremiumRatesTab`, and `DocumentsTab` components powered by dedicated hooks.
  - Centralize transform helpers and enums in `lib/insurance-plans` (add `transformers.ts`, shared formatters) and ensure the page consumes the new hooks (`useInsurancePlanDetails`, `useInsurancePlanRates`, `useInsurancePlanDocuments`).
  - Deliver component tests for the new layout primitives plus the first extracted tab, followed by hook tests covering rate calculations and document workflows.

- **Testing:** Not necessary.

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams
- **Shared list scaffolding:** Define a configurable `BatchListLayout` in `components/features/batches/shared/` that wires common filter state, result tables, pagination, and bulk actions. Batch-specific pages should supply columns, filter schema, and action handlers so we only implement the pattern once.
- **Detail layout primitives:** Create composable layout shells (`DetailPageHeader`, `DetailTabs`, `SummaryAside`) to standardize the large `[id]` pages. Place these in `components/features/shared/layouts/` and gradually replace ad-hoc flexbox markup.
- **Form state utilities:** Extract unsaved-change detection, dirty tracking, and confirm dialogs into `lib/forms/dirty-state.ts` with a matching `useDirtyStateGuard` hook. Reuse across member, employer, and batch edit flows.
- **Data layer consolidation:** Introduce thin API clients per domain under `lib/api/{domain}.ts` to hide fetch URL construction and response normalization. Hooks import these clients, reducing duplication and easing future swap to React Query.
- **Accessibility and design tokens:** While extracting components, audit for accessible labels, focus states, and consistent currency/date formatting. Record reusable formatters in `lib/formatters/` and leverage Tailwind config tokens.
- **Testing harness upgrades:** Create `__tests__/setup/renderWithProviders.tsx` to co-locate Providers (theme, query, context) and simplify component tests. Update new specs to use it and migrate legacy tests opportunistically.

## Refactor Sequencing
1. **Members detail page:** Biggest win and unlocks shared detail layout primitives, ledger components, and dirty-state utilities. Complete hook extractions and componentization here first.
2. **Employers detail page:** Reuse member abstractions, validating that shared layouts/hooks cover both personas.
3. **Batch list family:** Implement generic list scaffold, then refactor insurance premium, account contribution (list + detail), employer contribution, life insurance, and annuity interest pages.
4. **Insurance plan flows:** Apply list scaffold and turn detail actions into modular components.
5. **Remaining dashboard shells:** Tidy admin settings, dashboard overview, and batch job status once shared primitives mature.

Milestones should ship incrementally. After each phase, run `npm run lint` and targeted Jest suites; schedule a regression pass on staging before moving to the next block.

## Risk & Mitigation
- **Regression risk in mission-critical flows:** Pair each extraction with Jest component/hook tests and a manual checklist (data load, edit, save, cancel). Maintain snapshots for shared layouts.
- **Context/provider drift:** Document required providers in `docs/testing-plan.md` and enforce via the shared render helper to avoid missing wrappers.
- **Inconsistent formatting:** Gate merges on linting and ensure formatters/utilities centralize currency/date logic.
- **Refactor fatigue:** Time-box extractions (e.g., 2â€“3 days per tab or list page) and log open tasks in the repo Projects board to maintain momentum.
